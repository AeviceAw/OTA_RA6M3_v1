 *      Remark: Added isnan(HRmean) as the final check and did sanity checks with the Matlab version
 *              (YY 22-Dec) Turn Off On-Body Detection, Changed the bracket position of logf(Val+eps), dr = val + eps
 *              19-June-2021 Added the adaptive HRscalelocal size to cater low and high HR
